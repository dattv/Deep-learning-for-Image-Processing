# Tensorflow 2.0
This artist for noting some useful thing in using tensorflow 2.0 and python3.6

I collected this from [Tensorflow 2.0 quick start guide]() and [Tensorflow]()

## Tensorflow Ecosystem
1. [eager execution]()

2. [tf.data]() is an API that allows you to build complicated data input pipelines from simpler, reusable parts

3. [tensorflow.js]() is a collection of APIs that allow you to build and train models using either the low-level JavaScript linear algebra library or the high-level layers API. Hence, models can be trained and run in a browser.

4. [tensorflow lite]() is a lightweight version of TensorFlow for mobile and embedded device

5. [tensorflow hub]() s a library designed to foster the publication, discovery, and use of reusable modules of machine learning models. In this context, a module is a self-contained piece of a TensorFlow graph together with its weights and other assets. The module can be reused in different tasks in a method known as transfer learning

6. [tensor board]() is a suite of visualization tools supporting the understanding, debugging, and optimizing of TensorFlow programs

## How to install 
please follow [Install TensorFlow-gpu 2.0 on Anaconda for Windows 10/Ubuntu](https://medium.com/@shaolinkhoa/install-tensorflow-gpu-2-0-alpha-on-anaconda-for-windows-10-ubuntu-ced099010b21).

Basically, It's required conda => python 3.6, cudnn, cupti, cudatoolkit10.0 => tensorflow-gpu
