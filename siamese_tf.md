#Siamese Neural Network
This tutorial to learn how to develop Siamese Neural network with Tensorflow framework.
This is converted from [1]

## 
Assume that we want to build face recognition system for a small organization with only 10 employees.
if we use traditional classification apporach, we might come up with a system 

## Advantages of One-short learning
:+1: Require only one or afew training example for each class.
